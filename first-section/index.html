             background-color: #EAF6f6;
         } */
         
         /* changing the style of the hr */

             well it's really important to know that no website is completely unstyled, what does that mean?
             there's always a defult style applied by your browser how?
             go to your browser and search for browser default css, follow w3school. search for the hr.
             clearly you'll see border-style: inset; what does it mean? well it makes an element looks embeded.
             let's change it
             */
             /* border-style: none; */
             /* 
             actually every in your web dev is a whole bonch boxes. and this boxes can be affected by changing the css codes. we're going to be using what is called pesticide to view this by using this link to add it
             https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesticide-for-chrome/bakpbgckdnepkmkeaiomhmfcnejndkbi.
             => then go to the three dots and go to chrome setings => extensions => find the pesicide => details => allow acees to file URLs => click on
             pesticide icon to pin it if u like.

             now for us to solve this problem we're going to give it a height

             */
             /* height: 2px; */

             /* adding a width */

             /* width: 100px; */

             /*using % is the best in this aspect as it adjust it's self just as we increase or reduce the scree */
             /* width: 30%; */

             /*canging the looking of the hr*/
             /* border-style: dotted; */
             /* change the looking out of double. */
             /* height: 0;
             border-style: none;
             border-top-style: dotted; */

            border-width: 5px; */

            /* change the width */
            /* width: 5%; */
            /* now remove the background-color */
        
/* now check all this, did they affect other pages like, contact and hobbies?
no right that's where the external css comes into play
